        "##Process-based Python programming\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We will focus on the programming language called **Python**, and there are a couple of good reasons for that. Python is what’s called a ‘high-level language’, loosely meaning that the code you write is reasonable interpretable to a human being (technically, it means that the language has a high level of abstraction, which means that it hides many of the most computer sciency things from you, like managing specific memory locations in the computer). Python has been designed to be especially interpretable, and good code (called ‘pythonic’ code in the community) is considered code that is clear and easily interpretable, rather than necessarily producing the fastest possible execution. Python also has a very large user community and an immense amount of help and code examples online, so it a relatively easy language to learn. If you want to do more than is included in these notes, a highly-regarded introduction that is available online is the book called \\[[Learn Python the hard way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)].\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We will also focus on what I call process programming (not an official term), in which user interaction doesn’t happen (or is only used to initialize the program). Think of the .exe/.dmg file you use to install a piece of software on your Windows/OSX machine. You may specify a few things to start with, but after that the program simply runs, does its thing, and finishes. The same kind of execution characterizes a tool run in a geospatial software package, like one of the tools you might use in ArcGIS. You specify some parameters (called ‘arguments’ when they are passed to the tool), and when you click ‘Ok’ the tool executes without further interaction from you. The product of this kind of program is typically one or more files.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The alternative to ‘process programming’ is what I call ‘state-based programming’, in which a software has a certain state and user input modifies that state. Think of having ArcGIS open and a bunch of data sets loaded. ArcGIS is in a certain state, which is defined by the layers showing, the zoom level, your choice of geoprocessing options etc. It is this state that you save in the .mxd file when you save your ArcGIS project. Nothing in the state changes with time, except when you do something. Click the ‘zoom in’ button, for example, and the state changes. Add a data layer, and the state changes again. But if you leave the computer and go for coffee, nothing changes in the meantime (hopefully!). While state-based programming is very common and very useful, specifically for processing geospatial data most of what we want to do is process programming. And if we want to integrate our code in a state-based environment, we can create a tool out of it and use it in existing software that allows that.\r\n",

        "##Writing Python code – use an IDE\r\n",
        "Python code is most commonly stored in .py files, which are really just text files that have a special extension so we know what they are. Because they are text files, you can create and edit them in any text manipulation software, like Notepad, WordPad etc. (don’t use Word, .docx files are not pure text files!) However, once you start writing lots of code and try to accomplish difficult tasks with Python, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) gives you a bunch of tools to help you figure out what actually happens in each step of the code, and where things go wrong (and they always do, so an IDE is nice because it helps you fix them). I personally use PyCharm Community Edition as my IDE, which is free and you can download here: \\[[PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)]. Lab computers at the University of Ottawa also have other IDEs on them, like PyScripter and Spyder. There are similarities as well as differences between each IDE (try googling ‘best python ide’ for lots of highly opinionated contributions on why to choose one over another). In the end selection of IDE is mostly a question of preference. Another extremely useful tool for Python programming is Anaconda, which can help you manage multiple different Python environment, projects, and their associated code. Many people also use Jupyter Notebooks. If you are interested you should explore all these options – all of which are free.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "If you are reading this then you already know that in this course we are going to use the online Python IDE called Google Colab. This environment is based on ‘notebooks’ (you are reading one right now), which act as files for your Python code and simultaneously can show visualizations of your data and results. Notebooks are also easy to share online, and to work on collaboratively, so they can be very useful. They are not actually my favourite tool for writing, testing, and debugging code, but on balance I believe they are the best choice for a course like this one.\r\n",

        "It is good practice to provide some explanatory comments along with your code, like who wrote the code, when, and for what purpose. In normal Python, the way to do this is by using the ‘#’ character. In Python, all lines that start with ‘#’ are interpreted as notes that have no function, so these lines are ignored when you run the program. Their only function is to help humans like you and I understand what the code is supposed to do. So you can add as much commentary as you like to help future you (or future someone else) understand what your code is about. So for example you could write something like this (like last time, to see what happens when you execute this code, click on the code block and press Ctrl+Enter):"

        "Simple print statements aside, almost all of the useful things you can do with programming relies on the use of variables. You can think of variables as labeled boxes; each variable has a name (the label) and a value (the content of the box). The name cannot change (let’s say it’s written with a permanent marker), but the value can (because you can put stuff in and take stuff out of the box). Variables are useful in programming because referring to the variable name allows you to use the variable value. An example will help to illustrate it why this is useful. Imagine I create a variable named classSize. As of today’s date there are 41 students enrolled in your class, so that will be the value of that variable. Practically, I do it this way:"
