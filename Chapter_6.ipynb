        "#Chapter 6 – Reading, manipulating, and writing raster data\r\n",
        "Text files were relatively easy to deal with, because they have a simple format, and we know that we can treat all the data in them as text, and that it is structured line by line. Reading a more complex file format, like those typically used to store raster data, is more complicated. However, much of the complication has been hidden in objects and functions already created for us in what is called GDAL – the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library. \\[[GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/)] contains object types that we can think of as complex variables, like a ‘raster dataset’ that has different properties like a ‘datum’ and a ‘number of bands’ and so on. GDAL also contains functions to read, manipulate, and write such objects, so we don’t need to code every little detail of those complex operations ourselves.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "One big drawback is that GDAL is oddly complicated to import properly, especially on Windows machines. The main problem is that, to use GDAL, Python needs to know where all its files are, and because GDAL can be installed in many different ways, and especially because a computer can have multiple versions of Python installed, it quickly gets very confusing. But for the time being that is not going to stop us, because importing gdal in Colab is as easy as:"

If you want to get an idea of what the image looks like before working with it in Python (always a good idea), open it in one of the software packages you already know and take a look at its properties etc. QGIS is good for this, as you can install it on your home computer regardless of its operating system. If you do so, one thing you will notice is that the ‘first band’ in the image (e.g. what ArcGIS calls ‘Band_1’) is the ‘Red’ band. In other words it contains information on the amount of electromagnetic radiation in the 600-700nm wavelength range reaching the camera from different parts of campus. Similarly, the second band is ‘Green’, and the third band is ‘Blue’. If we are to use this image in an intelligent fashion, we need to know this."

        "1\\) The **dataset** is the entire, well, dataset, including all the data and all the metadata in one object. The dataset has certain properties, like a projection, a datum, a geotransform (that contain e.g. the pixel size), and so on. These are all defined for the dataset because they are a property of the dataset - they have to be the same for all the individual raster data layers in one dataset.\r\n",

        "2\\) The dataset is organized in **bands**. Bands also have certain properties, like the minimum and the maximum value. Similarly, these properties are defined for each band because they are a property of the band, not the dataset, and not the individual pixel. However, it is important to note that a band in GDAL is a ‘pointer’ to the data that are in the band itself, so you can ’open the band’ to access its properties (e.g. its minimum value) without having to actually read all the data. This may be confusing for now, but it will be clearer in the examples to follow.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "To map vegetation with three-band (red, green and blue) imagery, you can rely on the fact that most things other than vegetation, in the natural world, are not green. You can thus calculate a ‘greenness’ index as a proxy for vegetation. An often used index is the Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC), which is simply calculated as: Green / (Red + Green + Blue). Modify the code from this chapter to calculate the GCC, and write it to a new file called ‘gcc.tif’. Compare it to the original image to check that high GCC values actually correspond to vegetated areas, and vice versa."
