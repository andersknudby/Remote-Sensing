        "#Chapter 7 - Working with vector data\r\n",
        "This chapter will help you learn how to read and write vector data, and how to work with vector data and image data in combination - specifically how to extract values from a raster for locations indeitifed in the vector file. Working with vector data in Python is in some ways similar to working with raster data – GDAL provides a core structure that includes a dataset with properties, and the dataset can include a number of layers, layers contain features, and features have attributes (like the ones you see in the attribute table for any shapefile when you open it in a GIS software). On top of GDAL, several other Python libraries have been created to make handling vector data easier and quicker. To start with we need to get rasterio again, and also a library called geopandas"
